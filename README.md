Abstract :
	In India, agriculture is the largest source of livelihood, A vast fraction of the population of India considers agriculture as its primary occupation. Excessive use of fertilizer or using not enough fertilizer Leads to Bad quality crop production Identifying the equivalent Crop & Fertilizers is a research issue. The main benefits of the proposed system are as follows: Balancing crop production, Yielding the  right crop at the right time, Economic growth, and planning to reduce the crop meagreness.

 In this project, a three level each is proposed by Analyze the Various related attributes like location, pH value from which alkalinity of the soil is determined . Along with it, percentage of nutrients like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and
Potassium (K) Location is used along to Determine the  weather and temperature using API, nutrient value of the soil in that region, amount of rainfall in the region, soil composition can be determined. The three levels include soil identification, crop suitability, and recommendation of Fertilizer ,. Experiments were conducted using real time agriculture dataset and the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The experimental findings showed that the suggested approach provides more accurate and appropriate Crop & Fertilizzer recommendations
